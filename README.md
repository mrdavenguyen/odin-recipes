This is a small recipe website project that will test my profiency and ability 
to implement HTML basics that I have learned so far in The Odin Project. These
include:

* Creating boilerplate html
* Creating relative links between pages
* Adding images to pages
    * Resizing images
* Adding headings to pages
* Adding paragraphs to pages (descriptions of recipes)
* Adding emphasis and importance to text
* Adding lists
    * Unordered lists (for ingredients)
    * Ordered lists (for steps)
