    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta</strong>: Of course, you’ll need fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: This Alfredo sauce starts with two sticks of butter</li>
        <li><strong>Cream</strong>: The rich sauce calls for almost a cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: The fettuccine Alfredo is simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic salt</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: You’ll need Romano and Parmesan cheeses</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and cream together on the stove, season, and stir in the cheese.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta in the cheese sauce.</li>
    </ol>
